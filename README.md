🔍 Core Business Questions & Analysis

1. 📉 Does discounting influence sales?

Correlation - Discount vs Quantity	0.013, Discount vs Revenue	0.008


➡ Conclusion:
Discounting has negligible effect on both sales volume and revenue. Price elasticity is low — purchases appear more influenced by product appeal, brand trust, and seasonal trends.

> 🔁 Actionable Test: Introduce a small-scale 5% discount pilot on mid-performing SKUs to validate if micro-incentives change buying behavior.

---

2. 📈 Do higher sales always mean higher profit?

➡ No.
For instance, Bikes account for 52%+ of total revenue but rank lowest in profit margins. Meanwhile, Accessories deliver strong profit despite modest revenue share.

> ✅ Recommendation:


Shift marketing focus toward high-margin categories
Rethink pricing for low-margin high-volume items
Adjust procurement/sourcing strategies for low-profit segments


---

3. 📆 Are there seasonal trends impacting performance?

➡ Yes.
A revenue dip between May–July is visible, particularly for Bikes.

🧭 Possible Drivers:

Mid-year vacation planning delays purchases

Weather conditions or travel restrictions

Limited campaigns or product launches during Q2


> 🎯 Strategy:



Prioritize Q1 and Q4 for marketing and product launches

Use May–July dip for stock clearance, service add-ons, or upselling spare parts (e.g., Tires, Tubes)

💡 Strategic Recommendations

🔄 Optimize Product Mix: Reduce reliance on low-margin bestsellers

🚀 Invest in Emerging Segments: e.g., New Style Clothing — gaining traction with rising unit sales

❌ Phase Out Consistently Negative SKUs: 4–5 SKUs show repeated losses

🎯 Seasonal Targeting: Q4 and Q1 = campaign-heavy; Q2 = operations and service focus

🔍 Micro-Discount Testing: Controlled price reductions to validate elasticity and unit lift

🧺 Bundle Maintenance Products: Especially during off-peak seasons (e.g., tires + tubes)
